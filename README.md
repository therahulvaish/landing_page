Using flexbox is fun, but a bit complicated when you dive into deep, using the flexbox properties is very easy once 
you understand what you are thuing to achieve, making layout though flexbox is a great journey of learning 
I stuck sometimes, even deleted the entire project and then again started from scratch but in the end of last step 
of arranging everything it feels I (I made this on my own)

Note: Its ok te be stuck sometimes, but more important is that do not peep into others code while you can't do it by your own
come up with your own solution

DO NOT TRY TO TYPE A RICH CODE, IF ITS MESSY ITS OK, IT WILL GET BETTER THROUGHOUT THE JOURNEY.
